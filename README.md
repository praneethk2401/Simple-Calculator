## Code Analysis

The calculator uses a simple design with HTML and CSS for the user interface. The JavaScript code handles the logic for performing the arithmetic operations. The code is organized into functions that handle specific operations.

The `add()` function adds two or more numbers by iterating over the array of numbers and adding them one by one. The `subtract()` function subtracts two numbers by subtracting the second number from the first number. The `multiply()` function multiplies two numbers by multiplying them together. The `divide()` function divides two numbers by dividing the first number by the second number. The `clear()` function clears the calculator screen by setting the value of the screen to an empty string.

The code also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid input. If the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is displayed on the screen. If the user enters invalid input, such as a non-numeric value, an error message is also displayed on the screen.
